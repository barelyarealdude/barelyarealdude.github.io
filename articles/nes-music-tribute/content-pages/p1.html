		<h3>Intro</h3>
		<p>
			While I was at my uncle's house, I got to play Super Mario Bros. for the first time on a real NES.
			That same visit, my dad and I watched a playthrough of Blaster Master. I watched people play
			Zelda II and Castlevania II. I would get to play Link's Awakening and Kirby's Adventure thanks
			to my 3DS and Virtual Console. I <em>LOVE</em> old games.

			I've also been playing guitar for as long as I can remember. (literally -- since I was 4) I like all kinds
			of music: punk, rock, metal, 80s rap, etc. I have pretty varied tastes (unlike some people I know) but anything
			I listen to comes down to love for music and respect for the genre and history.
		</p>
		<p>
			Naturally, when you put those things together, you get something I like a lot. And I do.

		<h3>What is NES Music?</h3>
		<p>
			Music for the NES, duh.
		</p>
		<p>
			To be less mean, NES music is any music that is either designed to play on an NES, designed to play in a emulator
			of some sorts, or made completely within the limitations of original NES hardware. This means that music in NES games qualify
			just as much as Famitracker modules do. But "fake NES music" built in a DAW usually doesn't count unless it really sticks
			to the NES and its limitations.

		<h3>Styles and Trademarks</h3>
		<p>
			Every company back then had a different style of making their music for games. Nintendo generally took a pretty simple approach.
			Use lots of harmonies and have the progressions be complex to make up for the lack of range. Also, generally Nintendo stuck to making
			"catchy" songs that fit the vibe oof the area they were for. Cheery themes for sunny levels, damp themes for underground caves. Koji Kondo,
			composer for Super Mario Bros, gives a very Nintendo vibe with his music.
		</p>
		<p>
			Capcom generally did more hard rock and uplifting types of music for their games, such as Megaman. Speedy tunes that sound like thrash
			metal and hard rock were the standard, though for every boss level they had a slightly different vibe. Konami did a lot of
			varied work, including goofy stuff for games like Tiny Toon Adventures I and II, and more gothic, dramatic music for Castlevania.
		</p>
		<p>
			In my opinion, the gold standard for NES music is Sunsoft. Sunsoft took a very interesting approach regarding their NES music. Instead
			of having sampled drums...they had a sampled bass! The result is a more driving pace for melodies, and a generally tougher sound.
			Journey to Silius, Ufouria, and Gimmick! contain the best examples of this style in my opinion. Journey to Silius
			had the composer/programmer duo of Naoki Kodaka and Noboyuki Hara, and they produced probably the best soundtrack for any NES game I've ever
			heard. (And there are loads of good ones!)

			<p>
				Tragically, Noboyuki Hara died of a disease in the 1990s. He was in his mid-twenties. According to some internet-found anecdotes, 
				Kodaka was very fond of Hara. Apparently he was very cheery, and when Kodaka would finish a song, he would pass it to Hara to be put in.
				Once Hara did, Kodaka would review it. He always gave glowing remarks, and Hara would always beam in return. RIP.

		<p>
			There are some other styles of music very typical of certain composers. The names of Tim and Geoff (RIP as well) Follin might ring a bell,
			as they did several very acclaimed pieces of music, such as Solstice and Silver Surfer.

		<h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
		<p>
			I created a simple Famitracker module designed to test out a different style of composing. Most games on the NES either had two or three
			independent melodic lines going at once. You had the bass, a lead, and usually either a harmony channel, countermelody, or echo. I put the
			bass on the sample channel, allowing for the triangle channel (normally used for bass) to act as a countermelody. With this, I achieved
			four independent melodies, which can combine together to form a complex chord or split off to pull you into different directions. At times,
			the playback gets a little busy. I will continue to experiment with this style, as I think the extra component can be put to good use.
