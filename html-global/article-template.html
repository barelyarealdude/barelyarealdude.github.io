				<h1>Header (fill with article name: 'h1')</h1>
				<tag-line>
					Write a cheesy tagline for the article at hand here!
				</tag-line>
				<section>
					<h3>Subheader ('h3')</h3>
					<p>
						The "Writing guide" dictates that you should format your articles into sections.
						Use the 'section' element to do so.
					</p>
					<p>
						Separate your stuff into paragraphs using the 'p' element.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Another subheader</h3>
					<p>
						<subsection-2 style="float:right;width=20%">
							I really need this to display correctly. This should be a small little aside. It should
							<strong>NOT</strong> take up the whole width of a desktop screen.
						</subsection-2>
						I hope you enjoy the writings I offer here. They're not super thought provoking or anything,
						but isn't it the thought that counts?
					</p>
					<p>
						Anyways, this has been a quick and crappy demo of the way articles should be stylized and written.
					</p>
					<p>
						This last paragraph is to test how the subsection looks when the amount of writing overflows the size of the subsection.
						Just to check if everything wrap correctly and such. I really hope this ends up looking okay. Also, I want to test how the background
						image reacts when the page goes beyond what it should normally cover.
					</p>
					<p>
						Yknow, I really hope that anyone who sees this will come back. Obviously there are no guarantees, but maybe
						if I make it look decent they'll be back? You never know.
