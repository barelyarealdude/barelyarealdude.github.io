	<h1>Comparison -- VIC-20 vs. C64</h1>
	<tag-line>A quick delve into the differences between the platforms.</tag-line>
	<section>
		<h3>Intro</h3>
		<p>
			The VIC-20, released in 1980 in Japan and 1981 elsewhere, was a pretty successful computer for it's time.
			It boasted multi-color graphics, the BASIC programming language built-in, and ~3K bytes of RAM. It was a
			steady seller, but just a couple of years later, the C64 arrived on the scene. Featuring almost 10x the amount
			of BASIC RAM and a much bigger screen, it killed off the sales of the VIC-20. Just how different are the two
			machines, though?

		<h3>Specs</h3>

		<p>
			Both machines are based on the 6502 microprocessor, clocked at around 1Mhz. This puts the two machines at
			roughly the same speed. However, the C64 loses some performance due to badlines; occasionally, the video
			chip steals a few cycles from the CPU per scanline, leading to reduced performance.
		</p>
		<p>
			While the processor gives the C64 a slight hiccup, otherwise, it has the edge. The C64 features a 40-column
			wide screen, the same size as the PET. However, the VIC-20 has a 22-character wide screen by default, and
			it can only accomplish up to 27-characters. Worse, a few columns in extended column modes are lost to TV
			overscan. Regarding the color capabilities, both systems have 16 colors. The C64 has one advantage, though;
			all 16 colors can be used as the main text color, while the VIC-20 can only use 8 of its colors for the
			primary text output.

		<h3>Sound</h3>

			<p>
				Fun fact: the original design of the SID chip called for it to have 32 voices! This wasn't feasible;
				the designers copied a working oscillator twice instead to give the chip three voices.
			</p>
		</subsection-2>
		<p>
			The VIC-20 had a relatively impressive sound chip for its time. It featured three melodic channels and one
			noise channel, suitable for making drums. Compared to the competition, which generally didn't have sound
			capabilities, the VIC-20 was leagues above. However, it was generally used for simple jingles and sound
			effects.

		<subsection-2 style="float:left;margin-left:5px;margin-bottom:5px;max-width:300px">
			<p>A full feature set of the SID chip includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Three hardware sound channels which support sawtooth, pulse, triangle waves and noise</li>
				 <li> Low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass filters</li>
				 <li>Waveform hardsync and ring modulation (for triangle waves only)</li>
				 <li>Early models (6581) had a bug which produced a click every time the master volume was adjusted
				 <li>people used this to play samples by chaining multiple clicks</li>
			</ul>

		<p>
			The C64 stepped it up with the SID chip. Initially, it looks like a downgrade as it only features three channels,
			compared to the VIC-20's four channel output. However, these channels have three melodic waveforms + noise.
			The SID also features filter support along with ring modulation and waveform hardsync. By abusing the master
			volume, sampled sound could be produced. Initially, much like the VIC-20, it was only used for jingles and
			sound effects. Starting in 1983, simple music could be produced. By '85, composers such as Rob Hubbard were getting
			very <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrQuR1LHAVI">complex music</a> which switched between instruments 
			on the fly.

		<p>
			There is still a decent scene today focused on creating music for the C64. Some of it is quite impressive!

			as Planet M.U.L.E. It's a load of fun.)
